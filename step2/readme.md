# Cleaning the code from analysing parts

### In every data science projects we have to analyse and visualize data. We understand and identify the data according to problem we have to solve. At the end modelling begins. If we finished these processes, we design production code and pipelines considering business problem. If there is another team to solve this production side, then we deliver our script and solution strategy to them with lots of meetings.
